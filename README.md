## Data Science Projects

In this project, I used the City of Chicago's API to download ridership data for the L, then cleaned and visualized the data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly). My goal was to assess COVID-19's effect on ridership (it's down by almost 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels), then build a model to predict when ridership may recover, using Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

## Scientific Software Projects

In this project, I created an analysis package to clean, visualize, and analyze data from Columbus Instruments' Comprehensive Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). This system monitors metabolic parameters, like changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide, movement, and food/water intake. I created a simple user interface to remove electrical artifacts from the data, visualize any difference between groups, and run statistical tests for significant metabolic changes.

The objective of this project was to study how mice balance desire for a reward with the potential for risk. I built a system to track the location of mice throughout this task, correlating risk-seeking behavior with their brain activity, ultimately discovering a brain area that's active in risk-averse mice but not risk-prone mice.

In this project, I recorded brain responses while giving mice sugar water or plain water. I built the water delivery system and system for syncing brain recordings using a combination of Bpod and Arduino tools, as well as an electrical circuit for precisely measuring when the mice drink. This analysis package is published in a scientific journal [here.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01178-3)
